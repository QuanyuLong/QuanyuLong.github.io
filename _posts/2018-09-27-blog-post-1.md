Recieve the work of NER(QA4IE), I fund [a related work of NER](https://github.com/guillaumegenthial/tf_ner), which is implemented by advanced tensorflow API. The speed and the quality of NER are nice, I plan to redo the work of NER in QA4IE, enhancing the main entity recognizing score from 85% to 95%. In addition, I planed to use some dataset which is related to Weki. I ran several small experiments given by the author, and plan to learn basic knowledge of NER tormorrow.
